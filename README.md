# Blended_Images
This project retrieves images in a folder and create a transition blending effect using OpenCV.

In this project, I created a dynamic photo album which retrieves images in a folder and make transitions between one to the next one. For this purpose, OpenCV was used
using Python as a language. 

addWeigth() method is used to mix or swap between the actual image and the next. This allows to create a transition effect which iterates in a infinite loop until
a keyboard interruption happens.
